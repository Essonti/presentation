          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) 
            known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown to date.

            In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, 
            containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the network, 
            reached 20 GB (gigabytes). In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, 
            and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size. 
            The ledger size had exceeded 200 GB by early 2020.

          <h2>What is blockchain? </h2>
          <p>A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked together using cryptography.</p>
          <p>
            According to Bitcoin the blockchain acts as a universal record of every Bitcoin transaction ever made. 
            The blockchain is a ledger, or log, of those transactions and users on the network 
            collaborate to verify new transactions when they occur. 
            They're rewarded financially for this effort - an enterprise known as "Bitcoin mining".

          <p>
            Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree.
            Each block includes the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain.

          <p>
            Blockchain technology can be integrated into multiple areas. 
            The primary use of blockchains is as a distributed ledger for cryptocurrencies 
            such as bitcoin

          Blockchains allows immutable data. 
          All information stored on the blockchain is permanent and unable to be changed - immutable.

          <h3>Energy consumption</h3>
          <p>
            In 2021, a study conducted by Cambridge University determined 
            that Bitcoin (at 121.36 terawatt-hours per year) uses more electricity annually 
            than Argentina (at 121 TWh) and the Netherlands (at 108.8 TWh). 
          </p>
          <p>
            In March 2021 Bill Gates stated that 
            "Bitcoin uses more electricity per transaction than any other method known to mankind", 
            "It's not a great climate thing."

          <h3>E-Waste problem </h3>
          <p>
            In order to hold security and stability of network the difficulty of questions increases 
            all the time, you need more and more miners equipment.
